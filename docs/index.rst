Welcome to PyImp's documentation!
================================

**PyImp** is an easy to use tool that helps developers to identify the most important parameters of their algorithms.
Given the data of a configuration run with `SMAC3 <https://github.com/automl/SMAC3>`_, PyImp allows one to use *Forward Selection*, *Efficient Ablation* and *Influence Models* to determine which Parameters have the most influence over the algorithms behaviour.

**PyImp** is developed for python 3.5
